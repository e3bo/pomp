\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.15.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Eamon O'Dea identified a bug (Issue #54) occurring when \code{pomp} is called with a single-row data frame.
    This has been fixed using his contributed patch.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.14.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item A new \code{dmultinom} function is provided in \sQuote{pomp.h}.
    This provides the probability distribution function for the multinomial distribution.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.14.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Improved tests.
    \item Fixed bugs emerging in R-devel due to refactoring of underlying \R source code.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.13.4}{
  \itemize{
    \item Eamon O'Dea pointed out that the bug in \code{gillespie.sim}, addressed by version 1.12.3, was not completely fixed.
    This problem has now been resolved.
    In addition, covariates are now guaranteed to be evaluated at least once per observation interval.
    \item The new argument \code{hmax} to \code{gillespie.sim} allows the user to specify the maximum step size that will be taken before covariates are evaluated.
    \item The K-leap method has been removed.
    Its accuracy is low on test problems and it is difficult to make it compatible with the pomp paradigm.
    In particular, it does not readily accomodate time-varying covariates in a sensible way, nor does it lend itself to simulations at pre-specified times.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.13.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{bspline.basis} and \code{periodic.bspline.basis} now take an optional non-negative integer argument \code{deriv}.
    When \code{deriv > 0}, the order-\code{deriv} derivative of each basis function is returned.
    \item A new function, \code{periodic_bspline_basis_eval_deriv}, has been added to the C API.
    This function gives access, at the C level, to evaluation of the derivatives of periodic B-splines.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.13.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item Upgrade license to GPL version 3.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.13.1}{

  \itemize{
    \item Fix bug found by Eamon O'Dea in \code{gillespie.sim}.
    \item Fix bug in \code{onestep.sim}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.12.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item The Ricker example has a new parameter, \eqn{c}, which scales the (unobserved) population size.
    By default, \eqn{c=1}, so that the behavior is as before.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.12.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Improved error trapping.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.11.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item Some changes have been made to the use of random numbers in some codes (the stochastic simulations in \code{gillespie.sim} and the resampling in the particle-filtering codes).
    These changes will mean that calculations performed before will not be reproducible in perfect detail, but will be statistically equivalent.
    \item Minor changes in C codes to obviate warnings generated by T. Kalibera's \code{rchk} checks.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.11.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item The rare and fascinating \dQuote{Bug of St. Patrick} has been fixed.
    Thanks to Carles Breto for finding the bug and helping to isolate it.
    \item More informative error messages are generated when \code{dmeasure} returns a non-finite likelihood in any of the particle filtering codes.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.11.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Some streamlining of codes.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.10.6}{
  \itemize{
    \item Callable routines are now registered.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.10.5}{
  \itemize{
    \item More verbosity is provided with \code{verbose=TRUE}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.10.4}{
  \itemize{
    \item The functions \code{bake}, \code{stew}, and \code{freeze} now preserve information about the system time used in computation as an attribute of the returned object.
    In addition, these functions store information about the RNG settings.
    \item Some documentation improvements, courtesy of Sebastian Funk.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.10.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item Documentation improvements.
  }
}

  \itemize{
    \item More verbosity in building of Csnippets.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.10.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Better handling of \code{pomp}'s \code{times} argument.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.9.3}{
  \itemize{
    \item New \code{logLik} method for \code{pmcmcList} objects.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.9.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item The deprecated options to supply a matrix or numeric vector as the \code{data} argument to \code{pomp} have been removed and doing so now generates an error.
    The first argument to \code{pomp}, \code{data}, must now be provided either as a data frame or as an object of class \code{pomp}.
    See \code{?pomp} for details.
    \item The deprecated \code{skeleton.type} and \code{skelmap.delta.t} arguments to \code{pomp} have been removed.
    Using these arguments will now generate an error message.
    The correct method of specifying the deterministic skeleton is now explained in the help pages (\code{?pomp}).
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.9.1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Source code fixes to eliminate warnings during compilation.
    \item Improved test suite.
    \item Minor documentation correction.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.8.11}{
  \itemize{
    \item During particle filtering, when non-finite \code{dmeasure} values are generated, an error is generated and the offending parameters, states, data, and time are reported.
    In methods that use parameter transformations (\code{transform=TRUE}), the reported parameters were on the transformed (estimation) scale, which can be confusing.
    The error message now gives the parameters on the natural (model) scale.
    \item Modified \file{src/ssa.c} to fix UBSAN errors.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.8.10}{
  \itemize{
    \item C codes have been modified to take advantage of changes to the \R API (R SVN REVISION 71180).
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.8.9}{
  \itemize{
    \item A bug in \code{mif2} arising when filtering fails in the final timestep has been fixed.
    In this case, when all particles are deemed inconsistent with the data, we use an unweighted mean (with a warning) in place of the default weighted mean.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.7.7}{
  \itemize{
    \item The stochastic simulation algorithms underlying the Gillespie and K-leap methods (\code{gillespie.sim}, \code{kleap.sim}) have been refactored in C.
    In addition, errors due to accumulation of round-off error have been repaired.
    The result will be more accurate, but somewhat slower when there are a very large number of reactions.
    \item Further improvements to the test suite.
    Code coverage is now 100\%.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.7.6}{
  \itemize{
    \item In Sobol' sequence generation (\code{sobolDesign}, \code{profileDesign}), we now use the suggestion of Joe & Kuo (2003) to choose a better sequence start point.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.7.5}{
  \itemize{
    \item The generation of Sobol' sequences (\code{sobolDesign}, \code{profileDesign}) is now performed using the \pkg{NLopt} routines written in C instead of the original \acronym{TOMS} 659 FORTRAN codes.
    The copyright notices are located in the source code.
    \item Improved testing suite.
    \item Made \code{rw.sd} even more robust via new \code{safecall} class.
  }

    \item Modified the \dQuote{dacca} example to use C snippets.
    \item Refactored \code{rw.sd} for greater stability.
    \item Made Sobol' codes more robust.

\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.6.7}{
  \itemize{
    \item Improve the test suite and error messages.
    \item Replace the automatic \dQuote{verbose} setting during compilation under Windows.
    This was dropped in version 1.6.4.3, when it no longer appeared to be necessary.
    Apparently, it is, at least under some Windows OS/R combinations.
  }
}

    \item Update to the package help page.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.5.10}{
  \itemize{
    \item The matrix and numeric vector options for the \code{data} argument to \code{pomp} are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.4.9}{
  \itemize{
    \item A better interface for specifying a model's deterministic skeleton is provided.
    One specifies \code{skeleton=map(f,delta.t)} for a discrete-time skeleton (a map) and \code{skeleton=vectorfield(f)} for a continuous-time skeleton (a vectorfield).
    The old arguments \code{skeleton.type} and \code{skelmap.delta.t} are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

    \item \code{init.state} now has the optional argument \code{nsim}.
    Using this, one can request multiple initial state vectors per parameter vector.
    \item \code{pfilter} now uses less memory when it is asked to run at a single point in parameter space.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.4.5}{

  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.3.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item When several concurrent \R processes attempt to simultaneously compile \code{Csnipet} code from copies of a \code{pomp} object on the same machine, a race condition exists.
    This release fixes this by ensuring that \code{Csnippet} codes are written and compiled in a process-specific directory.
  }

    Initial-value parameters are designated using the \code{ivps} argument.
    \item The old \code{parameter.transform} and \code{parameter.inv.transform} arguments to \code{pomp} have been removed.
    They were superseded by the arguments \code{fromEstimationScale} and \code{toEstimationScale} in version 0.65-1.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.2.2}{
  \itemize{
